  <h1>This is the hardest song I've ever cleared.</h1>
	
  <p>Now, understand that when I say "cleared", I don't necessarily mean that it's the hardest song in the game. I just mean that this song is probably the highest limit on my speed and stamina. I never thought I would see this song through to the end without my life dropping to zero at any point, which is, admittedly, harder at home than it is in an actual arcade due to stricter life bars.</p> 
  <p>The point that I'm trying to express is that while this song isn't a 19 or even an 18, the things that it demands from you are beyond the pale for a song rated as a 17. While it's natural for there to be variance in difficulty between songs rated the same difficulty to the point where arguments about where some songs get placed rages on for years, this one in particular has elements to it that make me genuinely wonder how this one has held on to its rating as a 17 for over a decade. </p>
  <p> So let's take a look at the major-key nightmare of a steampunk-sounding song, the <em>twisted</em> mind of the <strong>Unfinished Steam Drive Girl.</strong> </p>

<h2>Part 1: Zero to Eleven</h2>
  <p>Given the way the song starts of with a slow steam sound section into sixteenth-note bursts, you'd think that would be just about all the song has the capacity for, given the existence of similar lower 17s like Perditus Paradisus and Possession.</p>
  <p><em>That's your first mistake.</em> In just 12 seconds this song wastes no time in establishing itself as being on par with its fellow mid-tier seventeens through lengthy 16th runs intermittently broken up by hold note patterns. To say nothing of the last one eschewing the hold notes for a full speed crossover, when your stamina has taken a bit of a blow.</p>
  <p>Be ready to hit a few more in just a few seconds, though, because even though you're given something of a break, there's some full-speed crossovers that stagger their rhythm just a few measures away. If you can make it through those, however, some much easier patterns await you.</p>

  <h2>Part 2: Routine Repairs</h2>

  <p>Oh did I say easier? Sorry, I meant easier to <em>execute.</em> <strong>Reading</strong> the following part is another sort of challenge, at least during the second half of the slowdown, full of 85 BPM 24ths. Trying to read these can be quite the challenge if you're not ready, since only every third note isn't the same green color and it makes the patterns difficult to discern.</p>
  <p>Generally, however, if you were able to make it here, you can keep your head above water in this part since, relative to the upcoming runs, they're slower, shorter, and you're given <em>four whole measures(!)</em> to recover your stamina during the hold notes.</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>"Upcoming runs"?</p>

  <h2>Part 3: Full Steam Ahead!</h2>
  <p>Oh you thought you would build back up into the real hard part of this song like you were at the beginning? You actually thought you'd be given a little bit of time to recover some more stamina before this chart throws everything it has at you in an 11-second assault on your feet, legs and core?</p>
  <p>Go play some 15s or 16s if you want mercy, these are the 17s, we don't play "buildup". You're getting 8 uninterrupted measures of 11 notes per second runs, complete with full-speed crossovers, and you're going to do it without missing more than twenty times or you're going back to the beginning with all your stamina lost.</p>
  <p>And even if you make it through those, don't think that's the end of everything this song has in store for you. Remember during the slowdown when there were 24th note jacks, all on the right foot? Well, bring those skills back so you can hit those stepjumps. Never mind that their placement relative to the notes leading into them is so awkward as to be comparable to footswitching...</p>
  <p>... and only then do she and the chart finally run out of steam.</p>
